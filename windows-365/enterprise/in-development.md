## App management

### Use conditional access to group Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop app policies together <!-- 36360788 -->

In a future update, you’ll be able to target Conditional Access (CA) policies to a single application that applies to both the Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop apps.

Currently, Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop share a common framework for identity access by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and security controls with CA policies. You can target CA policies to the Windows 365 app and this applies only to windows365.microsoft.com web client. To apply CA policies to the full Windows client and non-windows clients, you must assign CA policies to both the Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop apps.  For more information, see [Assign a Conditional Access policy for Cloud PCs](set-conditional-access-policies.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device management

### Support for Azure AD joined Cloud PCs<!-- 35060203-->

Windows 365 Enterprise will support Cloud PCs that are Azure AD Joined. These devices will run in a Microsoft-hosted network, so customers:

- Don’t need their own Azure infrastructure
- Don’t need to create an on-premises network connection.

### Support for Cloud PC sizes based on virtual graphics processing units (GPU)<!--35091874 -->

New Windows 365 licenses will be available that include virtual graphics processing unit options that support advanced graphic workloads on Cloud PCs.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Provisioning

### Provisioning maximum timeout changing to five hours<!--36461463-->

To improve reliability, the maximum provisioning timeout will be changed to five hours.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Role-based access control

### Custom Windows 365 RBAC roles<!--36222579 -->

In a future release, custom Windows 365 role-based access control (RBAC) roles will be available in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. You’ll be able to mix-and-match Windows 365 permissions to create custom roles for your organization's needs. You’ll also be able to create both Windows 365 and Intune custom roles and give granular admin permissions to admins for both services.
